## Twitter Text Classification Project using Neural Network

In this folder, it contains two part of my work on NLP techniques with Twitter Text Data.

First part is my Kaggle Competition submission and code which the relevant codes can be found under the folder Ref_KaggleCompetition.

Second part is my own work on scraping real tweets using Twitter API and work on further data cleaning, and at last perform different statistical analysis on the text data to find some patterns or insights. This continues my project on STAT694 which I analyzed the Twitter during the start of the COVID-19 lockdown.
